                "I served as an elisted Airman in the US Airforce and then as an Officer in the Army as a Tank commander on the M1 Abrams.  After my career in the Armed Services, I first fell in love with SQL Server in 1999 with our SQL 7 Release.  I was working as a Jr. DBA for a small company in North Carolina.  I knew virtually nothing about SQL Server and attended every conference I could afford and read every article I could find.   Over the next several years, I worked my way up the DBA ladder when I became the Sr. DBA for one of the largest banks in the US using SQL Server for eDiscovery and cyber forensics.   My dream was to become a Microsoft SQL Server Consultant.  After 3 grueling Finals-Day interviews at  Microsoft, and 3 heart breaking rejections for each of the 3 years, I was finally hired as a SQL Server Consultant in 2006 on my 4th attempt.  \n",
