                "The SQL Server system database, tempdb, has undergone a number of feature changes since SQL Server 2000.  While there are new tempdb usages and internal optimizations in SQL Server; the tempdb architecture is mostly unchanged since SQL Server 2000.  The tempdb system database is very similar to a user database.  The main difference is that data in tempdb does not persist after SQL Server shuts down.  Each time SQL Server restarts, tempdb is copied from the model database.  It inherits certain database configuration options, such as ALLOW\\_SNAPSHOT\\_ISOLATION, from the model database.  \n",

So, these operations are faster.  There are some feature restrictions in tempdb.  In addition, some of the database options cannot be modified for tempdb.  Auto shrink is not allowed for tempdb.  Database shrink and file shrink capabilities are limited.  This is because many of the hidden objects that SQL Server stores in tempdb cannot be moved by shrink operations.\n",

If a snapshot isolation transaction starts concurrently before the first transaction commits, the versions are kept until the snapshot isolation is complete.  So the version store must be kept for more than five hours.  A general method for estimating the size of version store is to multiply the size of the version store that was generated during the execution of the longest transaction by two.  When the database is enabled for snapshot isolation or RCSI, only the first update to a particular record in a transaction generates a version.\n",
