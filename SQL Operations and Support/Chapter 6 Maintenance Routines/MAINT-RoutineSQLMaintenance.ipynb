Reorganizing an index can reduce its fragmentation, can be interrupted at any time without a loss of work already performed, and can be run during production with almost no effect on performance. Rebuilding indexes will eliminate fragmentation in an index.  This process must complete in order to affect the performance of the database server.  The rebuild process is resource intensive, so rebuilding indexes should only be performed during maintenance windows.  It is common to reorganize indexes on a nightly or weekly basis and rebuild indexes on a weekly or monthly basis.  How often indexes should be reorganized and rebuilt depends on how quickly the indexes become fragmented.  The next section will describe one way to monitor for fragmentation which will help the DBA in deciding which indexes and databases should be maintained and the schedule for that maintenance.  You can read up on Index Maintenance here: [Maintenance Plans - SQL Server | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/maintenance-plans/maintenance-plans?view=sql-server-2017)\n",

Therefore, you should include an update statistics task in your maintenance plan. Updating statistics regularly can help further reduce the need for full index rebuild operations. A code Sample for updating Statistics will be provided below in the Configuration Section.  Brush up on your SQL Statistics Knowledge by reading this article: [Statistics - SQL Server | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/statistics/statistics?view=sql-server-2017) and [Default auto statistics update threshold change for SQL Server 2016 | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/psssql/default-auto-statistics-update-threshold-change-for-sql-server-2016)"
